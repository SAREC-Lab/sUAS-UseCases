# Hazard Identification and Mitigation for Human-Drone Interactions

The following hazards have been derived from a systematic study of publications reporting safety analyses techniques applied to the domain of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. They are supported by a [glossary of terms](glossary.md).

### Hazard Types

We have organized them into trees of related hazards. Our focus here is on exploring human-sUAS interaction hazards. Usage suggestions can be found [here](usage.md).

For each identified human-sUAS interaction point, we explore four specific types of hazards: 
<br> <sub>[![](human-interaction-hazards/icons/h-icon.PNG)](#) </sub> -  Human Initiated Hazards (e.g., the RPIC flies whilst inebriated, ignores regulations, and/or behaves in a reckless manner)
<br> <sub> [![](human-interaction-hazards/icons/s-icon.PNG)](#) </sub> - Loss of Situational Awareness, including lack of information and/or comprehension about the state of current/intended mission 
<br> <sub> [![](human-interaction-hazards/icons/e-icon.PNG)](#) </sub> - Lack of Empowerment to intervene in the situation (e.g., inability to override an autonomous decision made by a sUAS)
