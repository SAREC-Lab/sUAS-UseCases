# Hazard Identification and Mitigation for Human-Drone Interactions

The following hazards have been derived from a systematic study of publications reporting safety analyses techniques applied to the domain of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. 

### Hazard Types

We have organized them into trees of related hazards. Our focus here is on exploring human-sUAS interaction hazards. 

For each identified human-sUAS interaction point, we explore four specific types of hazards: 
<br>:one: human initiated hazards (e.g., the pilot flies whilst inebriated, ignores regulations, and/or behaves in a reckless manner)
<br>:two: loss of situational awareness including lack of information and/or comprehension about the state of current/intended mission 
<br>:three: lack of empowerment to intervene in the situation (e.g., inability to override an autonomous decision made by a sUAS)
<br>:four: the impact of system failures on human operators.  We then propose specific mitigations.
