# Hazard Identification and Mitigation for Human-Drone Interactions

The following hazards have been derived from a systematic study of publications reporting safety analyses techniques applied to the domain of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. We have organized them into trees of related hazards. Our focus here is on exploring human-sUAS interaction hazards. 

For each identified human-sUAS interaction point, we explore four specific types of hazards: :one: human initiated hazards (e.g., the pilot flies whilst inebriated, ignores regulations, and/or behaves in a reckless manner), :two: loss of situational awareness including lack of information and/or comprehension about the state of current/intended mission (e.g., inaccurate information about the health or location of a sUAS or not understanding why a sUAS behaves in a certain way), :3: lack of empowerment to intervene in the situation (e.g., inability to override an autonomous decision made by a sUAS), and finally :four: the impact of system failures on human operators.  We then propose specific mitigations.
