# Introduction

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) depend heavily on their surrounding environment...

## Environmental Assumptions

We categorize environmental assumptions into six groups...

> **Requirement:** The incubator must maintain its temperature within a specified range when operational.

This requirement depends on environmental factors such as:

> **Operational Environment:** The ambient temperature around the incubator is assumed to be within 20°C to 25°C.

> **Operational Environment:** The temperature sensors in the incubator are accurate to ±0.5°C.

These assumptions inform the derived requirements and shape the design solution...

### Managing Environmentally Complex Requirements

The interplay between functional requirements, assumptions, and runtime monitors can create a complex specification, analysis, and validation landscape...
