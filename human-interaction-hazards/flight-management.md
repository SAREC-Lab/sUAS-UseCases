## <a name="FX1">FX1: The operator fails to load accurate and current map for flight route planning.</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

## <a name="FX2">FX2: The operator launches UAVS from an area obstructed by trees, buildings, or people.</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>
Launching an sUAS from an obstructed area introduces the risk of collisions during takeoff.

## <a name="FX3">FX3: The operator assumes manual control for delivery of items but lacks real-time awareness of the remote UAV's position</a> <sub><sup>:two:</sup></sub>
Certain use cases require the UAV to 'touch the ground' (either directly or through dropping an item) in an obstructed area. 
The human and UAV must closely interact to perform these tasks safely.

## <a name="FX4">FX4: The operator assumes manual control for delivery of items but lacks fine-grained control of the UAV </a> <sub><sup>:three:</sup></sub>
Certain use cases require the UAV to 'touch the ground' (either directly or through dropping an item) in an obstructed area. 
The human and UAV must closely interact to perform these tasks safely.

## <a name="FX5">FX6: The operator plans intersecting flight routes for multiple sUAS</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

The operator needs to be able to plan intersecting flight routes without concern for collisions.

## <a name="FX6">FX6: The operator manually configures the same RTL altitudes for multiple UAVs</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

When flying multiple UAVs, they need to be assigned unique RTL altitudes in case all undergo failsafe RTLs simultaneously.
