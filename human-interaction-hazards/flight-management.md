## Hazard Tree: Mission Planning

To provide a scope for identifying relevant hazards and their mitigations we briefly summarize a set of features needed to support mission planning in a multi-UAV environment.  Mission planning functionality should provide support for:
   * Creating, storing, and retrieving flight routes defined as a set of waypoints (latitude, longitude, altitude).
   * Automatically generating flight routes for N drones to provide coverage over a region of the map specified by the user. 
   * Support for centralized and distributed goals and task allocations
