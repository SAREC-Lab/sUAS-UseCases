## Hazard Tree: Mission Planning

Not sure about this one.  We are missing the mission planning, but I don't think we found any specific human interaction faults about this in the lit study. But we have experienced some. e.g., Assigning wrong flight routes (far away).

We could *imagine* some, but they aren't derived from any literature study.
