## Hazard Tree: Mission Planning and execution

Mission planning can be achieved in several different ways. To provide a scope for identifying relevant hazards and their mitigations we scope mission planning as follows:
   * Creating, storing, and retrieving flight routes defined as a set of waypoints (latitude, longitude, altitude).
   * Automatically generating flight routes for N drones to provide coverage over a region of the map specified by the user. 
   * Support for centralized and distributed goal setting and task allocations in which missions are focused on achieving specific goals with potentially multiple UAVs and multiple tasks
   * Synchronized flights (e.g, flying in formations)
