## AX1: The operator is unable to handle multiple alerts simultaneously</a>

| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|AX-1|Multiple sUAS in flight|Alerts must be prioritized according to severity|
|AX-2|Multiple sUAS in flight|When system-wide failures occur the operator can freeze the entire mission so that all sUAS are commanded to hover in place. This gives the RPIC time to plan recovery strategies and/or to manually issue RTL or LAND commands to individual sUAS.|

## AX2: The operator is overwhelmed by status information for multiple UAVs.</a>

## AX3: The operator becomes overwhelmed by the multi-tasking required to manage multiple UAVs safely and according to all regulations</a>

## AX4: The operator focuses excessively on one aspect of the mission at the expense of other aspects (e.g., focuses on finding the victim but ignores safe UAV operation)</a>

| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|AX4-S1|Multiple human engagers | One operator is designated as the sUAS safety officer with primary responsibility for overseeing safe use of the sUAS. |
|AX4-S2|Multiple human engagers | The UI provides a screen dedicated to sUAS command and control. |
|AX4-S3|Multiple sUAS| System runtime monitoring constantly checks for safety violations and raises alerts when such violations occur.|

## AX5: The operator has an incorrect (errant) mental model of the current environment.</a>
