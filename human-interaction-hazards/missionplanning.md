## Hazard Tree: Mission Planning and Execution

**Description**

Mission planning can be achieved in several different ways. To provide a scope for identifying relevant hazards and their mitigations we scope mission planning as follows:
   * Creating, storing, and retrieving flight routes defined as a set of waypoints (latitude, longitude, altitude).
   * Automatically generating flight routes for N drones to provide coverage over a region of the map specified by the user. 
   * Support for centralized and distributed goal setting and task allocations in which missions are focused on achieving specific goals with potentially multiple UAVs and multiple tasks
   * Synchronized flights (e.g, flying in formations)

## Human-Drone Interaction Hazards 


### <sub>![](icons/e-icon.PNG)</sub>  MX1: The operator is unable to add, modify, or remove mission goals during the mission's execution
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|MX1-S1|Mission Execution|The system must empower the operator to manage the mission at runtime.|
|MX1-S2|Mission Execution|The operator can abort the entire mission at any time.|
|MX1-S2|Mission Execution|The operator can change the mission goals at any time.|

<br><br>

### <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>  MX2: The operator is unaware that a problem has occurred in the execution of the mission
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|MX2-S1|Mission Execution|If the UAVs are unable to complete a planned mission task, they must report their failure and any known causes.|

<br><br>

### <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>  MX3: The operator loses track of mission progress (e.g., in a search and rescue operation, the operator cannot easily review which parts of an area have already been searched)
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|MX-3-S1|Mission Execution|The system must track and display the progress of the mission as it unfolds.|
