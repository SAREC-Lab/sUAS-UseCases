Intro goes here.

<br>:construction: Need to add mitigations.

## UX1: Operator places UAVs too close to each other prior to launch <sub>![](icons/h-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |

|UX1-11|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX2: Operator places UAVs in location with insufficient clearance prior to launch <sub>![](icons/h-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |

|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX3: The operator is unable to rectify the camera failure during flight. <sub>![](icons/e-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX4: The operator does not realize that a camera failure has occurred (e.g., due to servicing multiple UAVs for which only a subset of camera feeds are visible) <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX5: The system does not provide appropriate information regarding the geofence, so the operator is unable to determine whether it has been set correctly or not <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX6: User is unaware that the system is not configured correctly <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX7: User is unaware that failsafe and other flight actions are configured incorrectly (e.g., RTL actions) <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX8: User is unaware that critical arming  checks are disabled e.g., satellite connections, accelerometer health)] <sub>![](icons/s-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX9: User has configured autopilot in an unsafe way (e.g., setting minimum number of satelite fixes required to 1, or setting the RTL altitude illegally high or dangerously low) <sub>![](icons/h-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX10: User has disabled critical arming checks prior to launch (e.g., deactivating the GPS fix during indoor maintenance) <sub>![](icons/h-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX11: Operator attaches overly heavy or insecured payload to UAV <sub>![](icons/h-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX12: Operator fails to perform flight-readiness check and/or fix problems (e.g., dangling cables, low battery) <sub>![](icons/h-icon.PNG)</sub>
| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|UX1-|Context here|Requirement here|

## UX13: It is difficult for the user to check and configure multiple UAVs simultaneously. <sub>![](icons/e-icon.PNG)</sub>
