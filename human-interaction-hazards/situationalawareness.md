## <a name="AX1">AX1: Operator is unable to handle multiple alerts simultaneously.</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|AX1-1|Multiple sUAS in flight|Alerts must be prioritized according to severity|
|AX1-2|Multiple sUAS in flight|When system-wide failures occur the operator can freeze the entire mission so that all sUAS are commanded to hover in place. This gives the RPIC time to plan recovery strategies and/or to manually issue RTL or LAND commands to individual sUAS.|

## <a name="AX2">AX2: Operator focuses on the life-saving mission at the expense of managing sUAS safety</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|AX2-1|Multiple human engagers | One operator is designated as the sUAS safety officer with primary responsibility for overseeing safe use of the sUAS. |
|AX2-2|Multiple human engagers | The UI provides a screen dedicated to sUAS command and control. |
|AX2-3|Multiple sUAS| System runtime monitoring constantly checks for safety violations and raises alerts when such violations occur.|
