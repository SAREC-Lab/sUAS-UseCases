## <a name="AX1">AX1: Operator is unable to handle multiple alerts simultaneously.</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

| Hazard addressed | Context | Solution |
|:--|:--|:--|
|AX1-1|Multiple sUAS in flight|Alerts must be prioritized according to severity|
|AX1-2|Multiple sUAS in flight|When system-wide failures occur the operator can freeze the entire mission so that all sUAS are commanded to hover in place. This gives the RPIC time to plan recovery strategies and/or to manually issue RTL or LAND commands to individual sUAS.|


## <a name="AX2">AX2: Operator is overwhelmed by status information for multiple UAVs.</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>

## <a name="AX5">AX5: Operator fails to supervise sUAS flights due to excessive trust in autonomy.</a> <sub><sup>:one:</sup></sub>
