|AX1-1|Multiple sUAS in flight|Alerts must be prioritized according to severity|
|AX1-2|Multiple sUAS in flight|When system-wide failures occur the operator can freeze the entire mission so that all sUAS are commanded to hover in place. This gives the RPIC time to plan recovery strategies and/or to manually issue RTL or LAND commands to individual sUAS.|
