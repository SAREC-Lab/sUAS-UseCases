 We apply for the *Artifacts Available* badge.
 
 Our dataset is publicly available via this GitHub repository and we provide an archived version of Hazard Tree snapshots via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4898774).
 
 However, our dataset and Hazard Trees are meant to be a community project and we encourage other researchers to comment on, contribute to, and extend the list of 
 Hazards and Mitigtations.
