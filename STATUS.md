 We apply for the *Artifacts Available* badge.
 
 Our dataset is publicly available via this GitHub repository and we provide an archived version of Hazard Tree snapshots via Zenodo.
 
 However, our dataset and Hazard Trees are meant to be a community project and we encourage other researchers to comment on, contribute to, and extend the list of 
 Hazards and Mitigtations.
