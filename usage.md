## Usage Suggestions

Teams building safety-critical software products need to perform rigorous hazard analysis in order to identify hazardous states and a set of mitigating actions. Typical approaches include Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) or Software Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA).

There are many different types of hazards, however, in the sUAS domain, the prescribed techniques tend to focus on system-level hazards while paying scant attention to the unique human interface aspects of multi-user, multi-agent systems that are emerging in the sUAS domain.  The hazard trees provided in this repository are intended to assist users in performing project-specific hazard analysis and/or evaluating and specifying requirements.

In this diagram, the human-sUAS interaction hazard `The human operator has incorrect information about a UAV's position' is refined into system-level (blue) and user-interaction (yellow) sub-hazards. Example mitigating requirements are also shown here.
