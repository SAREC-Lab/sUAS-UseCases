h1 System hazard
h2 P1: Physical Preflight UAV  setup misses important checks 
h3 P2: UAVs are not placed correctly for launch
h4 P3: UAV is not  flight-ready 
h5 P6: UAV is not  configured correctly for flight
h8 P7: The payload is too heavy or unbalanced
h11 P4: Camera is not functioning correctly
h12 P5: No geofence has been established

u1 [h] PX2 Operator places UAVs in location with insufficient clearance prior to launch
u2 [h] PX1 Operator places UAVs too close to each other prior to launch
u3 [h] PX9 Operator attaches overly heavy or insecured payload to UAV
u4 [h] PX10 Operator fails to perform flight-readiness check and/or fix problems (e.g., dangling cables, low battery)
u6 [h] PX8 User has configured autopilot in an unsafe way (e.g., setting minimum number of satelite fixes required to 1, or setting the RTL altitude illegally high or dangerously low)
u9 [s] PX4 The system does not provide appropriate information regarding the geofence, so the operator is unable to determine whether it has been set correctly or not
u11 [e] PX11 It is difficult for the user to check and configure multiple UAVs simultaneously.
u14 [s] PX5: User is unaware that the system is not configured correctly
u12 [s] PX7: User is unaware that critical arming  checks are disabled e.g., satellite connections, accelerometer health)]
u13 [s] PX6: User is unaware that failsafe and other flight actions are configured incorrectly (e.g., RTL actions)
u16 [s] PX3: The operator does not realize that the camera isn't working (e.g., due to servicing multiple UAVs for which only a subset of camera feeds are visible)
u17 [h] P12: The user sets switches on hand-held controller incorrectly (e.g., throttle, RTL, LAND)
