h1 System hazard
h2 C1: Communication failure  e.g., GCS failure  Loss of wireless signal Jammed communication |xref: W1
h3 C2: Communication failure between ground  and UAVs 
h4 C3: Communication failure between UAVs
h5 C4: Hand-held controller, which serves as a backup solution for controlling the UAV fails and is unable to send commands to the UAV.
h7 C6: Hand-held controller fails while the software-based GCS is still functioning.
h8 C7  Hand-held controller fails at the same time as the software-based GCS meaning that there is no means of controlling the UAV.
h6 C5: Software-based GCS control system fails and is unable to process and/or send commands to UAVs

u1 [s] CX5 The human operator doesn't understand the cause of the communication problem.
u2 [e] CX1 The human operator is unable to control the UAV using the hand-held controller.
u3 [e] CX4 The operator cannot rely on forwarding of messages to remote UAVs via UAV-to-UAV messaging.
u4 [s] CX2 The operator is unable to receive status data from the UAVs and loses situational awareness.
u5 [e] CX3 The operator is unable to send directives to UAVs and loses direct control.
u7 [e] CX6 The operator is notified that the hand-held controller has failed but is unable to fix the problem during flight.
u6 [h] CX7 The RCPIC accidentally deactivates or unplugs the communication device such as a dongle or antenna causing loss of communication.
