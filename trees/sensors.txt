h14 S14: The UAV's emergency parachute is deployed accidentally during flight despite no emergency
h15 S3: The operator is unable to control the UAV.

u2 [s] SX5: The operator loses track of the UAV's geolocation
u3 [e] SX4: The operator is unable to evaluate the severity of the problem and/or resolve the situation.
u1 [s] SX6: The camera that provides video stream and supports onboard vision is no longer available to the operator 
u8 [h] SX7: The operator accidentally deploys the UAV's emergency parachute during flight.
u4 [e] SX1: The UAV hovers in the sky and is unresponsive to operator commands
