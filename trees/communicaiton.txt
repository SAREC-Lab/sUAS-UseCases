h1 System hazard
h2 C1: Communication failure  e.g., GCS failure  Loss of wireless signal Jammed communication |xref: W1
h3 C2: Communication failure between ground  and UAVs |xref:S11
h4 C3: Communication failure between UAVs|xref:S11
h5 C4: Hand held controller providing a backup means of communication fails when it is needed.  for manual flight loses connectivity to UAV
h6 C5: Ground control system for multi-UAVcommunication fails

C4: ONLY hand held fails: Backup controller fails, generates a warning, and operator can override the warning.
C4: Both have failed: CX1-S2 both have failed we were using this is the primary communication
CX3-S1 write as a solution.  Save stuff and display upon request.

u1 [s] CX5 The human operator doesn't understand the cause of the communication problem.
u2 [e] CX1 The human operator is unable to control the UAV using the hand-held controller.
u3 [e] CX4 The operator cannot rely on forwarding of messages to remote UAVs via UAV-to-UAV messaging.
u4 [s] CX2 The operator is unable to receive status data from the UAVs and loses situational awareness.
u5 [e] CX3 The operator is unable to send directives to UAVs and loses direct control.
