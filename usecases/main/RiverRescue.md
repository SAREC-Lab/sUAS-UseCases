## Use Case: River Search and Rescue

**Description**

Multiple UAVs dispatched to search for victim in river

**Primary Actor**

Drone Commander

**Supporting Actors**

Semi-autonomous UAV

**Stakeholders and Interests**

- Fire department engaged in river rescue
- FAA concerned with flight regulations
- General public

**Pre-Conditions**

- DroneResponse is running
- Multiple UAVs are equipped with cameras
- A victim is in the river

**Post Conditions**

Success end condition

The victim is found by a UAV and actively tracked until a first responder takes over the rescue operation

Failure end condition:
 The victim is not found or the victim is found but not actively tracked.

**Trigger**

The Drone Commander activates the search.

## Main Success Scenario

1. UAVs are [activated and armed](../supporting/ActivateAndArm.md)
2. Emergency responders [initiate area search](../supporting/InitiateAreaSearch.md)
3. The DroneResponse commander issues a command to start the mission.
4. The UAVs [perform synchronized takeoff](../supporting/SynchronizedTakeoff.md)
5. The UAVs [perform area search](../supporting/PerformAreaSearch.md)
6. When a potential victim is detected by a UAV at a confidence level about [victim_detected] threshold and raises a [victim_detection] event.
7. DroneResponse forwards the event to all UIs registered to receive victim_detection alerts.
8. The UAV immediately switches to [active tracking](../supporting/ActiveTracking.md) mode.
9. DroneResponse requests [victim confirmation](supporting/VictimConfirmation.md) from the human operator.
10. The UAV receives confirmation from the human operator that the victim sighting is valid.
11. DroneResponse automatically sends the GPS coordinates to the mobile_rescue system.
12. Human responders arrive at the scene.
13. The Drone Commander [ends mission](supporting/EndMission.md).

## Exceptions

1. All [general exceptions](../../README.md#GeneralExceptions) apply, except for those with [in_air] preconditions.

2. In step 7, the UAV detects a possible victim at a confidence level below [victim_detected] threshold but above the lowest [ignore_level]
   * 2.1 The UAV raises a notification including saved imagery
   * 2.2 DroneResponse saves the GPS coordinates of the sighting
   * 2.3 The UAV continues its currently assigned route.
   * 2.4 The back-up operator reviews the streamed imagery
   * 2.5 The back-up operator confirms that the sighting is not a victim.

3. In step 10 the human operator refutes the validity of the sighting.
   * 3.1 The UAV resumes its previous search activity in Step 5
   
4. In step 8, the UAV does not have permission to start automatic tracking when it detects a candidate victim 
   * 4.1 The UAV continues its search as described in step 5 without switching to tracking mode.
   * 4.2 If the human operator confirms the victim sighting, the original UAV immediately attempt to relocate the victim and start tracking.
   
5. At any time after a victim has been detected
   * 4.2 The human operator reassigns a new UAV to perform the tracking task
