## Use Case: Structural fire fighting

**ID**

UC4

**Description**

Multiple UAVs dispatched to analyze the structure for fire fighting

**Primary Actor**

- Drone Commander

**Supporting Actors**

- Semi-autonomous UAV

**Stakeholders and Interests**

- Fire department engaged in fire fighting

- FAA concerned with flight regulations

- General public

**Pre-Conditions**

- DroneResponse is running
- Multiple UAVs are equipped with cameras

**Post Conditions**

_Success end condition:_

The UAV creates and maintains a heatmap of the entire building

All UAVs return to launch without damage at the end of the incident

_Failure end condition:_

A UAV collides with the building or ground

The UAVs fail to provide an accurate heatmap of the building 


**Trigger**

The Drone Commander activates the fire support mission.

## Main Success Scenario

1. Firefighters request [flight authorization](../supporting/FlightAuthorization.md)
2. UAVs are [activated and armed](../supporting/ActivateAndArm.md)
3. The UAVs [perform synchronized takeoff](../supporting/SynchronizedTakeoff.md)
4. The UAVs use their onboard vision to create an initial mapping of the building.
5. The UAVs plan optimized and coordinated surveillance flights around the building.
6. Prior to each leg of the surveillance flight, each UAV [leases airspace](../supporting/LeaseAirspace.md) the necessary airspace.
7. Each UAV performs [image capture and analysis](../supporting/ImageCaptureAndAnalysis.md) using thermal imagery.
8. Imagery from each UAV is continuously streamed and aggregated to create a current heatmap of the building.
9. Steps 4-7 are repeated throughout the fire event
10. The Incident Commander [ends mission](../supporting/EndMission.md) once the fire has been controlled.

## Exceptions

1. All [general exceptions](../../README.md#GeneralExceptions) apply.

2. In step 7, the UAV detects a possible victim at a confidence level below `[victim_detected]` threshold but above the lowest `[ignore_level]`
   * 2.1 The UAV raises an alert and requests [victim_confirmation](../supporting/VictimConfirmation.md) from the human operator.
   * 2.2 The UAV continues to stream imagery
   * 2.3 The human operator inspects the video stream
      * 2.3.1 If the human operator believes that a victim may have been found, firefighters plan and execute a rescue mission.
      * 2.3.2 If the human operator rejects the candidate sighting, the UAV continues its currently assigned route.
