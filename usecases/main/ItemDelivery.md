## Use Case: Deliver item to a specific location

**ID**

UC2

**Description**

UAV(s) are dispatched to deliver an item to a target location.

**Primary Actor**

- Drone Commander

- Dispatcher 

**Supporting Actors**

- Emergency Responders

**Stakeholders and Interests**

Recipient of the delivered item e.g., victim in a river receiving a flotation device, heart-attack victim receiving a defibrillator

**Pre-Conditions**

- DroneResponse system is active
- UAVs equipped with carry mechanism
- UAVs are able to carry required payload

**Post Conditions**

_Success end condition:_

The item is successfully delivered to the intended target

_Failure end condition:_

The UAV fails to reach the target coordinates

The UAV reaches the target coordinates but drops the item incorrectly (e.g., on top of a victim, in an unreachable location)

**Trigger**

The UAV receives a command to deliver an item


## Main Success Scenario

1. The delivery UAVs are [activated and armed](../supporting/ActivateAndArm.md).
2. The Drone Commander selects target GPS coordinates from a map. 
3. The UAV requests [flight authorization](../supporting/FlightAuthorization.md).
4. The DroneResponse commander issues a command to start the delivery mission.
5. The UAV [performs synchronized takeoff](../supporting/SynchronizedTakeoff.md).
6. The UAV [flies to the target destination](../supporting/FlyToDestination.md).
7. The UAV [drops the item](../supporting/ItemDrop.md).
8. The UAV establishes a safe flying altitude and sets its target destination to its home latitude and longtitude coordinates and [flies to the target destination](../supporting/FlyToDestination.md)
9. Once the UAV arrives at its home coordinates it LANDS.

## Alternative Steps 

1. In step 2, instead of the operator entering GPS coordinates, the coordinates are generated by a UAV based on its onboard vision.

2. In step 8, instead of flying home, the operator provides coordinates for an alternate safe landing location in the vicinity of the delivery.

## Exceptions

1. All [general exceptions](../../README.md#GeneralExceptions) apply.

2. In step 2, instead of using a map, the operator manually enters GPS coordinates.  The use case continues with step 3.
