## Use Case: Ice Search and Rescue

**Description**

UAV(s) aids in ice search and rescue including finding the victim under the ice.

**Primary Actor**

Drone Commander

**Supporting Actors**

Semi-autonomous UAV

**Stakeholders and Interests**

- Fire department engaged in river rescue
- FAA concerned with flight regulations
- General public

**Pre-Conditions**

- DroneResponse is running
- Multiple UAVs are equipped with cameras
- A victim is in the river

**Post Conditions**

_Success end condition:_

The victim is found by a UAV and actively tracked until a first responder takes over the rescue operation

_Failure end condition:_

The victim is not found or the victim is found but not actively tracked.

**Trigger**

The Drone Commander activates the search.

## Main Success Scenario

1. UAVs are [activated and armed](../supporting/ActivateAndArm.md)
2. Emergency responders  [dynamically generate flight routes for the targeted area](../supporting/AreaFlightRouteCoverage.md)
3. The DroneResponse commander issues a command to start the mission.
4. UAVs assigned the searching task [perform synchronized takeoff](../supporting/SynchronizedTakeoff.md)
5. The UAVs [lease airspace](../supporting/LeaseAirspace.md) and fly their assigned flight routes.
6. When a potential victim is detected by a UAV at a confidence level about [victim_detected] threshold a [victim_detection] event is raised.
7. DroneResponse forwards the event to all UIs registered to receive victim_detection alerts.
8. The UAV immediately switches to [active tracking](../supporting/ActiveTracking.md) mode.
9. DroneResponse requests [victim confirmation](../supporting/VictimConfirmation.md) from the human operator.
10. The UAV receives confirmation from the human operator that the victim sighting is valid.
11. Human responders arrive at the scene with their own flotation devices. They attempt a rescue.
12. The Drone Commander [ends mission](../supporting/EndMission.md).


## Exceptions

1. All [general exceptions](../../README.md#GeneralExceptions) apply, except for those with [in_air] preconditions.

2. In step 6, the UAV detects a possible victim at a confidence level below [victim_detected] threshold but above the lowest [ignore_level]
   * 2.1 The UAV raises a notification including saved imagery
   * 2.2 DroneResponse saves the GPS coordinates of the sighting
   * 2.3 The UAV continues its currently assigned route.
   * 2.4 The back-up operator reviews the streamed imagery
   * 2.5 The back-up operator confirms that the sighting is not a victim.

3. In step 10 the human operator refutes the validity of the sighting.
   * 3.1 The UAV resumes its previous search activity in Step 5
   
4. In step 8, the UAV does not have permission to start automatic tracking when it detects a candidate victim 
   * 4.1 The UAV continues its search as described in step 5 without switching to tracking mode.
   * 4.2 If the human operator confirms the victim sighting, the original UAV immediately attempt to relocate the victim and start tracking.
   
5. At any time after a victim has been detected 
   * 4.2 The human operator reassigns a new UAV to perform the tracking task
   * 4.3 The current UAV waits to be assigned a new task (e.g., rejoin the search, return home)
